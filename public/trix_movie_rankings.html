<hr />

<h3>Good Will Hunting</h3>

<p>
    The story is very interesting. A lot of emotional value and lessons from the movie. <br />
    Robin Williams performance is very good.
</p>

<h3>The Internship</h3>

<p>
    Very fun, light-hearted movie. Great to watch, and very motivating. <br />
    One of the few movies I will occasionally watch.

<h3>Harry Potter: Half-Blood Prince</h3>

<p>
    Pinnacle for the series itself. Very dark and eerie. <br />
    All the Harry Potter movies are very good, this is just my favorite.
